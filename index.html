            <h4>1. Counterfeit currency detection :</h4>
            <p>This deals with the matter of identifying the currency that if the given sample of currency is fake. Different 
                traditional strategies and methods are available for fake currency identification based on the colours, width, and 
                serial numbers mentioned. In the advanced age of Computer science and high computational methods, various 
                machine learning algorithms are proposed by image processing. Detection and recognition methods over the 
                algorithms include entities like colour, shape, paper width, image filtering on the note. Counterfeit currency 
                detection is a major issue around the world, influencing the economy of pretty much every nation including India. 
                The utilization of fake money is one of the significant issues looked all through the world now days. The forgers 
                are getting more earnestly to find as a result of their utilization of profoundly trend setting innovation.</p>

                <h4>2. An auxiliary diagnostic system for parkinson’s disease :</h4>
                <p>The objective of this project is to develop an auxiliary diagnostic system for Parkinson's disease using the Machine 
                    Learning algorithm. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people 
                    worldwide. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. 
                    The proposed system aims to provide an objective and efficient way of diagnosing Parkinson's disease through 
                    the analysis of various physiological and clinical features of patients. The system will use machine learning 
                    algorithms, particularly the ML algorithm, to classify patients into either Parkinson's disease or control groups 
                    based on their features. The Bernoulli NB Classifier algorithm will then be trained on the selected features to 
                    build a model that can accurately classify patients. The proposed system has the potential to improve the 
                    accuracy and efficiency of Parkinson's disease diagnosis, leading to earlier detection and better treatment 
                    outcomes. Overall, this project aims to develop an auxiliary diagnostic system for Parkinson's disease that can 
                    assist healthcare professionals in making more accurate and objective diagnoses.</p>
